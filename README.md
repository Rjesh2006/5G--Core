# [5G--Core]()

*The 5G core, often referred to as the 5G Core Network, is a key component of 5G cellular networks. It represents the central part of the 5G architecture, providing the backbone for communication services in a highly advanced and efficient manner. Here are some key aspects of the 5G core:*


- **Centralized Architecture:** Utilizes a more centralized network architecture.
- **Low Latency:** Enables low-latency communication for real-time applications.
- **Network Slicing:** Divides the network into multiple virtual networks for different use cases.
- **Service-Based Architecture (SBA):** Adopts a service-oriented approach for network functions.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Leverages cloud-native principles for scalability and flexibility.
- **Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS):** Separates control and user plane for improved efficiency.
- **Edge Computing Integration:** Integrates with edge computing for distributed processing.
- **Network Function Virtualization (NFV):** Utilizes virtualized network functions for agility.
- **Massive IoT Support:** Designed to handle connectivity for a massive number of IoT devices.
- **Network Automation:** Emphasizes automation for efficient network management.
