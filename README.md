# [5G--Core]()

*The 5G core, often referred to as the 5G Core Network, is a key component of 5G cellular networks. It represents the central part of the 5G architecture, providing the backbone for communication services in a highly advanced and efficient manner. Here are some key aspects of the 5G core:*


- **Centralized Architecture:** Utilizes a more centralized network architecture.
- **Low Latency:** Enables low-latency communication for real-time applications.
- **Network Slicing:** Divides the network into multiple virtual networks for different use cases.
- **Service-Based Architecture (SBA):** Adopts a service-oriented approach for network functions.
- **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Leverages cloud-native principles for scalability and flexibility.
- **Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS):** Separates control and user plane for improved efficiency.
- **Edge Computing Integration:** Integrates with edge computing for distributed processing.
- **Network Function Virtualization (NFV):** Utilizes virtualized network functions for agility.
- **Massive IoT Support:** Designed to handle connectivity for a massive number of IoT devices.
- **Network Automation:** Emphasizes automation for efficient network management.

  
## 5G core fn

*The 5G core functions include components like the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF), Session Management Function (SMF), User Plane Function (UPF), and others. These functions work together to enable the key capabilities of 5G networks, such as high data rates, low latency, and massive device connectivity.*




### 5G Core Functions in short terms we can understand whats the work's of their functions in core networking.

1. **AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function):**
   - Manages access and mobility for user devices.

2. **SMF (Session Management Function):**
   - Controls session establishment, modification, and termination.

3. **UPF (User Plane Function):**
   - Handles user data forwarding in the data plane.

4. **UDM (Unified Data Management):**
   - Manages user-related data and authentication.

5. **AUSF (Authentication Server Function):**
   - Responsible for user authentication and security.

6. **NSSF (Network Slice Selection Function):**
   - Facilitates network slicing for tailored services.

7. **PCF (Policy Control Function):**
   - Enforces policies for Quality of Service (QoS) and resource allocation.

8. **NEF (Network Exposure Function):**
   - Allows authorized third-party access to network services.

9. **UDR (Unified Data Repository):**
   - Stores and manages subscriber data.

10. **AF (Application Function):**
    - Supports service-specific applications in the network.
